# IDS & SCSU Hackathon Feb. 2024 Challenge 4 - Immersive Report

## Team: GeoViz
 - *Member names here*

## Challenge Description
IDS creates PDF reports for clients all the time, but those reports lose one of the biggest things we bring to the table, geospatial visualization of data. Weâ€™d like to combine these two things into an immersive report. This can be thought of as a guided tour that will walk users through the data in a report or query in an immersive map view.

### Features
 - Play/Pause
 - Step through each item of the report
 - Smoothly transition between report items
 - Report should determine the best way to move through the data spatially (needs to move in a logical way through 3D space)

## Pillars
Inform, Explore

## Technologies
 - [React](https://react.dev/)
 - [deck.gl](https://deck.gl/)
 - [react-map-gl](https://visgl.github.io/react-map-gl/)
 - [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/community/education)
 - [GLTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/)

## Test Data
This challenge uses a GLTF model for visualization.

## Target Outcome
Implement a deck.gl map view that displays a 3D model and supports the listed features. A list of random geographic points on the map, in the model, and around the model should be generated to be used for testing the tour.

## Culture Index Survey
Immersion Data Solutions has engaged with a behavior assessment company, Culture Index. We use it to better understand the intrinsic motivational needs and preferred communication style of our team members; ensuring their current roles fit their strengths and fulfillment needs.

We are pleased to offer you the chance to take the assessment and view your results. The process takes roughly 8 minutes or less. By participating, you will gain insights into your own behavioral tendencies and preferences, which can be invaluable for personal and professional development.

[Please begin assessment here.](https://surveys.cultureindex.com/s/jytaqq125Q/48857) Within the 'job title' field, please enter  **SCSU**  and we will share the results with you.
